# Full stack React - Portfolio

In this lab, I'll be creating a full stack portfolio page using Express and React to see how I can create a full stack project using a simple API build with express and a frontend application with React.

NOTE While the above repo has the backend and frontend folder in one repo, to deploy the backend and frontend project, it MUST be in separate repos.
